# Portfolio
Hi!
In this repository, you will find some projects from my portfolio.
If you are interested, you can download the files and learn a little about my work!
Here are some descriptions about each project:

## ChessGame
This project basically consists of a PvP chess game produced only with HTML, CSS and Javascript (without the use of libraries like JQuery).
In it, you'll find an intuitive environment that allows anyone to play (even people who don't have much knowledge in chess).
In addition to being able to play using a nickname, you can make classic chess moves like En Passant and Pawn Promotion.
Download the ChessGame folder, open the "menu.html" file and enjoy it!
