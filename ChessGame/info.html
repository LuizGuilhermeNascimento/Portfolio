            <p>This is a classic chess game project built from HTML, CSS and Javascript, without the use of design tools and libraries (like JQuery).</p>
            <p>The game is composed with PvP format. By clicking on the "NEW GAME" button, both players will be able to enter their names before the game, which starts with player 1 (white pieces).</p>
            <p>If you don't have much experience with chess or don't remember the movement of each piece, don't worry! When clicking on a piece, the squares, which you can move the piece, will change color.
            When a check or checkmate occurs, the game will inform the player (threatened or loser).</p> 
            <p>If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism, let me know via Github or Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiz-guilherme-sousa-nascimento-7bb605236/).
            Enjoy the game!</p>
